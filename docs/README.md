# Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the landing pages comparison project.

## Table of Contents

### [Best Practices](./best-practices/)
Comprehensive guides for implementing clean, maintainable code:
- **Semantic HTML** - When and how to use semantic elements
- **CSS Architecture** - Layout + Content pattern for scalable styling
- **CSS File Organization** - Separation by concern and file structure

### [Code Smells](./code-smells/)
Documentation of anti-patterns and better alternatives:
- **CSS Class Naming** - Avoid mirroring HTML tag names

## Organization Principles

- **Separation of Concerns** - Best practices vs anti-patterns are organized separately
- **Focused Documents** - Each topic gets its own dedicated file
- **Actionable Guidance** - Practical examples developers can immediately apply
- **Scalable Structure** - Easy to add new documentation as the project grows

## Contributing

When adding new documentation:

1. **Choose the right category** - Best practices for positive patterns, code smells for anti-patterns
2. **Create focused documents** - One topic per file when substantial
3. **Include examples** - Show both good and bad approaches
4. **Update indexes** - Add links in the appropriate README.md files
