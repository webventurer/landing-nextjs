This page demonstrates the **power of MDX** - a format that lets you write JSX in Markdown documents. You get the best of both worlds: the simplicity of Markdown for content authoring and the power of React components for interactive elements.

**Enhanced Styling**: This page now uses **SCSS (Sass)** for advanced CSS preprocessing, featuring variables, mixins, and nested selectors for better maintainability and organization.

**Font Optimization**: This page uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load multiple Google Fonts: Inter for body text, JetBrains Mono for code, and the modern Poppins for headings - all with automatic font swapping and performance optimizations.

## What Makes This Implementation Special?

This page combines multiple powerful technologies:

### üé® **SCSS Preprocessing**

- **Variables**: Consistent colors, spacing, and fonts throughout
- **Mixins**: Reusable styling patterns for headings and code elements
- **Nesting**: Organized selector hierarchy for complex components like tables
- **Better Maintainability**: Change design tokens once, update everywhere

### üìù **MDX Content Authoring**

- Write content in **familiar Markdown syntax**
- Embed React components directly in the content
- Create rich, interactive documentation and landing pages
- Maintain type safety with TypeScript
- Leverage the full Next.js ecosystem
- **Benefit from automatic font optimization** with `next/font`

> **Pro Tip**: The combination of SCSS + MDX + React components provides the most powerful and maintainable approach for content-heavy applications with complex styling needs.

### üöÄ **Interactive Features Grid**

Here's our features grid, but now embedded directly in MDX content:

<FeaturesGrid />

### üìù **Content Authoring Experience**

The beauty of MDX is that **content creators** can focus on writing while **developers** build reusable components. Here's how easy it is to embed components:

```jsx
// Just write components directly in your content!
<FeatureCard
  emoji="‚ú®"
  title="Amazing Feature"
  description="This component is embedded in MDX!"
/>
```

<InfoBox>
  **üí° Developer Note**: The component above is rendered using our shared
  FeatureCard component, but the content creator didn't need to know React -
  they just used it like a shortcode!
</InfoBox>

## Advanced MDX Features

### Custom Styled Boxes

<HighlightBox>

### ‚ú® Highlighted Content

This is a custom styled box that showcases important information. MDX lets you combine Markdown, HTML, and React components seamlessly.

</HighlightBox>

<WarningBox>
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: While MDX is powerful, remember to keep your component API
  simple for content creators!
</WarningBox>

<SuccessBox>
  ‚úÖ **Success**: MDX strikes the perfect balance between developer power and
  content creator simplicity.
</SuccessBox>

### Code Examples with Syntax Highlighting

MDX makes it easy to include code examples:

```typescript
// TypeScript example - fully type-safe MDX components
import type { MDXComponents } from "mdx/types";
import { FeatureCard } from "./components/FeatureCard";

export const mdxComponents: MDXComponents = {
  FeatureCard,
  // Map HTML elements to custom React components
  h1: ({ children }) => <h1 className="custom-h1">{children}</h1>,
};
```

### Lists and Formatting

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text** with `**text**`
- _Italic text_ with `*text*`
- `Inline code` with backticks
- [Links](/) work perfectly
- And much more!

1. Numbered lists
2. Work great too
3. With full styling support

## Real-World Use Cases

MDX is perfect for:

- **Documentation sites** (like Docusaurus, Nextra)
- **Blog posts** with interactive demos
- **Landing pages** with rich content (like this one!)
- **Marketing pages** that need both content and components
- **Educational content** with embedded examples

## Technical Implementation

### How This Page Works

1. **Content**: Written in `content.mdx` using Markdown syntax
2. **Components**: Reused from the shared components directory
3. **Styling**: Enhanced CSS modules with MDX-specific classes
4. **Integration**: MDX is processed by Next.js at build time
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for components used in MDX
6. **Font Optimization**: Uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Inter font with zero layout shift

### Font Optimization Features

<InfoBox>
  **üé® next/font Benefits**: This page uses `next/font` to automatically
  optimize and load Inter, providing automatic font swapping, zero layout shift,
  and improved performance compared to traditional web font loading.
</InfoBox>

Key font optimization features:

- **Automatic font swapping** with `display: 'swap'`
- **Zero layout shift** through size calculations
- **Preloading** for critical fonts
- **CSS custom properties** for easy theming
- **TypeScript support** for font configuration

```typescript
// Font optimization with next/font - Multiple Google Fonts
import { Inter, JetBrains_Mono, Poppins } from "next/font/google";

const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  variable: "--font-inter",
  display: "swap", // Prevents invisible text during font swap
});

const jetbrainsMono = JetBrains_Mono({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  variable: "--font-jetbrains-mono",
  display: "swap",
});

const poppins = Poppins({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  variable: "--font-poppins",
  display: "swap",
  weight: ["400", "500", "600", "700"], // Multiple weights for headings
});
```

### Developer Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Content in MDX, logic in React components
- **Reusability**: Components work in both regular React pages and MDX
- **Performance**: Static generation with Next.js optimizations
- **DX**: Great developer experience with hot reloading and TypeScript

### Content Creator Benefits

- **Familiar Syntax**: Just Markdown with occasional component usage
- **No Build Process**: Content creators don't need to understand React/TypeScript
- **Preview**: Can see changes immediately with Next.js dev server
- **Collaboration**: Easy to review content changes in version control

---

**Bottom Line**: MDX gives you the **authoring simplicity of Markdown** with the **power and reusability of React components**. It's the best of both worlds for content-rich applications.
