Welcome to the **Landing Pages Technology Comparison** project! This Next.js application demonstrates different approaches to building web pages, helping you understand which technology stack works best for your needs.

## üéØ Project Goal

This project showcases **five different ways** to create the same landing page, allowing you to compare approaches and see which one you prefer. We start with basic HTML and progressively enhance with modern web technologies.

<InfoBox>
  **Why Compare Technologies?** Each approach has its own strengths and
  trade-offs. By seeing them side-by-side, you can make informed decisions about
  which technology stack to use for your projects.
</InfoBox>

## üöÄ Live Demonstrations

Click on each link below to see the different implementations. Each page demonstrates the same landing page content but built with different technologies:

### ‚Üí [**1. Basic HTML Page**](http://localhost:3000/html/comparison1.html)

- **Technology**: Pure HTML + CSS
- **Pros**: Simple, fast loading, no dependencies
- **Cons**: Repetitive code, hard to maintain, no reusability

### ‚Üí [**2. HTML + Tailwind CSS**](http://localhost:3000/html/comparison2.html)

- **Technology**: HTML + Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Pros**: Rapid prototyping, consistent design system
- **Cons**: Violates separation of concerns, HTML becomes unreadable

### ‚Üí [**3. HTML + CSS Modules**](http://localhost:3000/html/comparison3/index.html)

- **Technology**: HTML + modular CSS files
- **Pros**: Clean separation of concerns, maintainable styles
- **Cons**: Still repetitive HTML, limited reusability

### ‚Üí [**4. React Components**](http://localhost:3000/comparison4)

- **Technology**: React + TypeScript + CSS Modules
- **Pros**: Component reusability, type safety, dynamic content
- **Cons**: More complex setup, requires JavaScript knowledge

### ‚Üí [**5. React + MDX + SCSS**](http://localhost:3000/comparison5) ‚≠ê üîó

- **Technology**: React + MDX + SCSS preprocessing
- **Pros**: Easy content authoring, component reusability, advanced styling with variables/mixins, excellent maintainability
- **Cons**: Requires understanding of Markdown, React, and SCSS

<SuccessBox>
  **Winner**: React components + MDX + SCSS for the ultimate combination of
  ease-of-use, powerful functionality, and maintainable styling!

## üí≠ Key Insights

After building all five versions, here are the main takeaways:

> **Basic HTML** is too heavy with design clutter and becomes unmaintainable as projects grow.

> **Tailwind CSS** violates separation of concerns - mixing design logic with content makes HTML unreadable and unmaintainable.

> **CSS Modules** provide clean separation of design from content and are much better than inline styles or Tailwind.

> **React Components** enable reusable blocks of JSX for dynamic content and state management. Write once, use everywhere!

> **SCSS Preprocessing** adds powerful features like variables, mixins, and nesting that make CSS much more maintainable and organized.

> **React + MDX + SCSS** combines the best of all worlds: easy-to-read structured content with the power of React components and advanced styling capabilities.

<HighlightBox>
  **The Winner**: SCSS + MDX + React components provide the perfect balance of
  content authoring simplicity, developer power, and styling maintainability.
  It's the most comprehensive solution when you see it in action!
